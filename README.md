Alright, I'm working on a Pixel Dungeon Mod, and since it's a requirement of the license to show the code (and I would have forked this here regardless as I'd like for anyone else who wants anything I plug into the game for their own projects to be able to do so.) I've worked on this for a few hours, but I forgot to fork it a few days ago and my current code is on my other computer, so I'll be making my first commit later.

Here's the current todo and done list:

Done:
+ Expand the available character slots (now there's eight instead of four).
+ New level type - Tower has been started
+ New NPC added - Kyle the Caiman's Motivational Speaker Man (no graphics yet sadly)
+ Ability to play music from module files like .mod, .it etc. (This took about an hour because of one error, lol...)

Todo:
* Replace graphics of all main characters (the mod is essentially Pixel Dungeon with a load of random items from games and series I've made, so this is the main goal.
* Add new mobs and npcs
* Add game modifiers (Different stage sets, permanent day/night mode, etc.)
* Challenge mode.
* Making unlock conditions for new characters.
* Move as much text as possible into android's text management (allows translations, yay!).

(If anyone else has ideas for features, please let me know)

Current goals:
* Completely replace Warrior's graphics
* Completely finish first npc

Feel free to examine anything you like, and take things for your own mods...with credit of course!
